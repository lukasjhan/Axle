# Spec Version Matrix

The single source of truth for the specification versions this SDK implements and tracks. Every row
is implemented in **both** the Kotlin and Swift trees unless noted, and verified against shared golden
vectors (`vectors/`) and live interop where available.

Last full spec audit: **2026-07-09** (all six anchor specs cross-checked clause-by-clause against both
language trees — see [Detailed coverage & known gaps](#detailed-coverage--known-gaps) below).

Legend: ✅ implemented · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not yet.

## Formats & crypto

| Spec | Anchor version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CBOR | RFC 8949 (deterministic encoding §4.2.1) | ✅ `cbor` / `CborCose` — RFC 8949 Appendix A vectors pass both languages; bytewise + length-first key ordering profiles |
| COSE | RFC 9052 §4.2 `COSE_Sign1` · RFC 9053 ES256/384/512 · RFC 9360 x5chain | ✅ verify (JCA / swift-crypto) + sign (`CoseSigner` → `SecureArea` port); COSE-WG Sign1 vectors pass. `COSE_Mac0` sign + verify (HMAC 256/256) |
| JOSE / JWS | RFC 7515 / 7518 subset (compact, ES256/384/512) | ✅ `sdjwt` / `SdJwt` — in-house, fixed-`alg` verification (no negotiation) |
| JWE | RFC 7518 ECDH-ES direct + A128/192/256GCM | ✅ Concat KDF (RFC 7518 Appendix C vectors) — encrypts `direct_post.jwt` / `dc_api.jwt` responses and OpenID4VCI Credential Requests; decrypts Credential Responses (`JweRecipientKey`). `kid` header per OpenID4VCI §10 |
| HPKE | RFC 9180 base mode — DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256) / HKDF-SHA256 / AES-128-GCM | ✅ `mdoc` `Hpke` / `MDoc` — **seal** (wallet) and **open** (verifier/reader) of the `org-iso-mdoc` DC API response (ISO 18013-7 Annex C). RFC 9180 A.3 vector pins `seal` both languages; `open` (KEM decap + AEAD open via `RecipientKey`) round-trips it and rejects tampered ciphertext / wrong `info` / wrong recipient |
| SD-JWT | RFC 9901 | ✅ issue / present / verify, KB-JWT, recursive & array disclosures, decoys; RFC disclosure vectors (73 entries) pass both languages. `alg=none` explicitly rejected on the issuer JWT and KB-JWT (§7.1(2.a)/§7.3(5.b)); KB-JWT `iat` validated against a configurable acceptable window (§7.3(5.e), `KbRequirement.maxAgeSeconds`/`skewSeconds`). Gaps: §7.1(6) `exp`/`nbf` enforced only in the VC layer, §8 JWS JSON serialization absent (optional) |
| SD-JWT VC | draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-17 (2026-07-06) | 🟡 `SdJwtVcVerifier` — typ/iss/vct enforcement, time validation, issuer-key resolution (`.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer` + x5c), holder binding, status extraction. **Type Metadata (§4) and `vct#integrity` entirely unimplemented**; the legacy `vc+sd-jwt` typ is rejected — a [deliberate non-goal](#deliberate-non-goals) |
| ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdoc | :2021 | ✅ `mdoc` / `MDoc` — `IssuerSigned`/MSO, `DeviceResponse`, selective disclosure, device signature **and `deviceMac`** (holder + reader), reader auth (§9.1.4). MSO digest SHA-256 only; `DeviceResponse` errors/status semantics not modeled |
| X.509 PKIX | RFC 5280 | ✅ `trust` / `Trust` — chain validation (path build, validity, basic constraints), SAN, x509_san_dns / x509_hash; x5c adapters for SD-JWT VC issuers, mdoc issuer/reader, and signed issuer metadata |

## Issuance (OpenID4VCI)

| Spec | Anchor version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OpenID4VCI | 1.0 Final (2025-09-16) | ✅ `openid4vci` — pre-authorized & authorization-code (+PAR), offer resolution, scope-preferred; **signed metadata** (§12.2.2 `Accept` negotiation + §12.2.3 `application/jwt` with `typ`/`alg`/`sub`/`iat`/`exp` rules); **live-issued a real PID from `issuer.eudiw.dev`** and **live-verified signed metadata from `dev.issuer-backend.eudiw.dev`** (see `INTEROP.md`). **encrypted Credential Requests/Responses** (§8.2/§10, ECDH-ES + A*GCM, live-verified against `issuer.eudiw.dev`) — same on the **deferred endpoint** (§9.1); deferred issuance surfaces the §8.3 `interval` (`IssuanceState.Deferred(retryAfter)`) and handles §9.2 202 re-deferrals. Gaps: `attestation` proof type, `credential_identifiers` — see audit below |
| PKCE | RFC 7636 (S256) | ✅ |
| DPoP | RFC 9449 | ✅ jti/htm/htu/ath + DPoP-Nonce retry |
| OAuth Attestation-Based Client Auth | draft (wallet attestation + PoP) | ✅ WUA client authentication during issuance |
| HAIP | 1.0 Final | ✅ **issuance profile complete, both languages** — PAR/DPoP/PKCE required, wallet attestation, key attestation, batch, deferred, notification, refresh-token reissuance, signed metadata policy (OpenID4VCI §12.2.2/§12.2.3) |

## Presentation (OpenID4VP & proximity)

| Spec | Anchor version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OpenID4VP | 1.0 Final (2025-07-09), DCQL | ✅ `openid4vp` — DCQL engine (null wildcard, values, claim_sets, credential_sets), JAR request resolution, `vp_token` (SD-JWT+KB-JWT and mdoc `DeviceResponse` — `deviceSignature` or, when the verifier's `deviceauth_alg_values` requests it, `deviceMac` per ISO 18013-7 B.4.5), `direct_post` + `direct_post.jwt` (JWE — §8.3 `alg`-matched key selection, `kid` echo, `apv`-bound nonce), reader trust for signed requests, DC API `expected_origins` replay check (Appendix A.2), JAR hardening (`typ`, request-object `client_id` equality, `wallet_nonce`, case-sensitive `request_uri_method`), §8.5 Authorization Error Responses (`VpErrorCode` taxonomy + `reportError`; decline reports `access_denied` and follows the verifier's `redirect_uri`). Gaps: DCQL `multiple`/`trusted_authorities`/`require_cryptographic_holder_binding`, `transaction_data` partial — see audit below |
| ISO/IEC 18013-5 device retrieval | :2021 §9 | 🟡 `proximity` / `Proximity` — QR **and NFC static handover** engagement, ECDH session keys (HKDF, salt = SHA-256 of the tag-24 SessionTranscript), `SessionEstablishment`/`SessionData` framing, encrypted exchange, reader authentication; **holder and reader** sides (`wallet.reader`). Device auth: `deviceSignature` **and `deviceMac`** end-to-end (holder derives the EMacKey via the `SecureArea` key-agreement port; `PresentationConfig.mdocDeviceAuth` — one knob shared with the OpenID4VP mdoc path). BLE (both modes) + NFC APDU transports are **Android demo host adapters only — no iOS transport**. **Live device-to-device interop with Multipaz** (BLE both modes + NFC, see `INTEROP.md`) |
| ISO/IEC 18013-7 / DC API handover | :2025 Annex C | ✅ origin-bound mdoc `SessionTranscript` + **HPKE-sealed `org-iso-mdoc` response** for the Digital Credentials API. Annex B follows OpenID4VP 1.0 Final's handover, which superseded the TS-literal `OID4VPHandover`; Annex A (website REST retrieval) is a [deliberate non-goal](#deliberate-non-goals) |
| W3C Digital Credentials API | browser-mediated (dc_api / dc_api.jwt) | ✅ `wallet.presentation.startDcApi` — no HTTP, response object returned to the platform |

## Status & audit

| Spec | Anchor version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| IETF Token Status List | draft-ietf-oauth-status-list | ✅ `statuslist` / `StatusList` — fetch + verify status token (signature + issuer chain), cached, index lookup |
| Transaction log (ARF / GDPR) | ARF transaction logging | ✅ `txlog` / `TransactionLog` — relying party (id/name/trusted/chain), per-document disclosed claims, history/query |

## Detailed coverage & known gaps

Findings of the 2026-07-09 clause-by-clause audit. Unless noted, every gap is symmetric — present
(or absent) in **both** the Kotlin and Swift trees, which remain line-for-line ports of each other.
Only what is 🟡/⬜ is listed; everything else in the tables above verified clean.

### RFC 9901 (SD-JWT) — coverage: high

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `exp`/`nbf` on processed payload | §7.1(6) | 🟡 lives only in the VC layer (`JwtTimeValidator`), not the core `SdJwtVerifier` |
| Holder rejects SD-JWT+KB from Issuer | §7.2 | ⬜ no guard in `SdJwtHolder` |
| JWS JSON serialization | §8 (optional) | ⬜ compact only |
| End-to-end RFC vectors | Appendix A | 🟡 RFC vectors cover disclosures only (73 entries); no full issuer-JWT/presentation/KB fixture — E2E tests self-issue |

### SD-JWT VC — coverage: verifier core complete, Type Metadata absent

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Type Metadata — all of it** | §4 | ⬜ no vct resolution/retrieval, `extends`, display/rendering (simple or svg_templates), claim metadata, or JSON-schema validation; §4.7 processing never runs in verification |
| `vct#integrity` / `#integrity` | §2.2.2.2, §5 | ⬜ never read or validated |
| Metadata resolver edge cases | §3.1/§3.2 | 🟡 jwks-XOR-jwks_uri not enforced; trailing-`/` in path-bearing `iss` not stripped |
| did-based key resolution | §2.5 (optional) | ⬜ |

### OpenID4VCI 1.0 — coverage: high

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `attestation` proof type | §8.2.1.3 | ⬜ only `jwt` proofs sent (key attestation rides in the `key_attestation` JOSE header, which **is** implemented) |
| `credential_identifier(s)` issuance flow | §3.4/§6.2/§8.2 | ⬜ requests always use `credential_configuration_id`; token-response `authorization_details` parsed-but-ignored (Kotlin) / not parsed (Swift) |
| `tx_code` input hints | §4.1.1 | ✅ exposed to the host as `TxCodeSpec` (length / input_mode / description) on `CredentialOffer` and `IssuanceState.TxCodeRequired`; `validate(code)` returns advisory violations. Not enforced by the SDK — the hints are for rendering, and a mismatch is the issuer's call, not ours (headless: no input screen to gate) |
| `mso_mdoc` format | §3.3.1 | 🟡 opaque-string passthrough; live-tested Kotlin only, untested in Swift |

### OpenID4VP 1.0 — coverage: core solid

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| DCQL `multiple` | §6.1/§8.1 | ⬜ not parsed; vp_token structurally always emits one presentation per query |
| DCQL `trusted_authorities` | §6.1.1, §15.10 | ⬜ not parsed or matched. Three types with very different costs: `aki` is self-contained, `etsi_tl`/`openid_federation` need standing trust infrastructure. Matching is `SHOULD` and the Verifier re-validates issuer trust regardless (§6.1), so the feature buys data minimization, not security — see [implementation notes](#dcql-trusted_authorities--implementation-notes) |
| DCQL `require_cryptographic_holder_binding` | §6.1 | ⬜ wallet always binds (KB-JWT / device signature); unbound presentations unsupported |
| Client ID prefixes `verifier_attestation` / `decentralized_identifier` / `openid_federation` | §5.9.3/§12 | ⬜ trust verifier handles x509_san_dns/x509_hash/redirect_uri only |
| `fragment` response mode | §8 | ⬜ rejected as unsupported |
| `transaction_data` | §8.4/B.3.3 | 🟡 SD-JWT VC KB-JWT hashes wired; no unsupported-type rejection, no `credential_ids` binding, no mdoc path, no test coverage |

#### DCQL trusted_authorities — implementation notes

Scoped ahead of time so the work is shovel-ready when the [trust cluster](#trust--deliberately-sequenced-last)
comes up at the end of the roadmap.

Matching is an OR of an OR (§6.1.1): a credential matches if any value of its chain matches any entry
of `values` in any entry of the array. The array is attached per Credential Query, so different
requested credentials can carry different trust conditions.

| Type | What the value is | How it matches | Trust infra needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aki` | base64url of the AKI `keyIdentifier` (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.1) | read the AKI extension of every cert in the credential's chain, base64url it, compare | none — byte compare |
| `etsi_tl` | identifier (URL) of an ETSI TS 119 612 Trusted List | ≥1 cert of the chain must appear in that list **or its cascading lists** | pre-resolved TL cert set |
| `openid_federation` | Entity Identifier, usually a Trust Anchor | a valid trust path from the credential's issuer to that anchor must be constructible | pre-resolved federation paths |

The chain is already reachable from `trust`'s x5c adapters: SD-JWT VC carries it as `x5c` in the JWS
header, mdoc as `x5chain` (CBOR label 33) in the `IssuerAuth` `COSE_Sign1` protected header.

Traps to pin with tests when this lands:

- **Read the AKI bytes; never derive them.** The 20-byte SHA-1-of-issuer-public-key form is RFC 5280's
  *method 1* convention, not a matching rule. A CA may emit method 2 (truncated 60-bit) or an arbitrary
  identifier, and computing the digest ourselves would silently mismatch.
- **Walk the whole chain, not just the leaf.** §6.1.1.1 explicitly allows a credential to carry the full
  X.509 chain or only parts of it.
- `keyIdentifier` is ASN.1-OPTIONAL. Absent → no match, never an exception.
- **Never fetch a Verifier-supplied URL** (§15.10). `etsi_tl` / `openid_federation` values are cache keys,
  not fetch targets; an unresolvable value is a no-match. Retrieving them at request time leaks wallet
  usage to whoever hosts the URL, and a per-request unique URL becomes a tracking beacon.
- Matching is `SHOULD` (§6.1), so no-matching an unresolvable type stays conformant. A credential that
  fails to match is treated as **absent from the wallet** (§6.4.2) — it must never surface in selection.

Interop caveat: `eudi-lib-ios-openid4vp-swift` decodes these entries with the keys
`trusted_authority_type` / `trusted_authority_values` rather than the spec's `type` / `values` — its own
`OpenId4VPSpec` constants and its Kotlin sibling both use the spec names, and it ships no fixture for the
field. Spec-compliant requests fail to decode there, so it is not a usable interop oracle for this field.

### ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 — coverage: data model & session crypto solid, transports thin

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Single-purpose mdoc auth key | §9.1.3.4 | 🟡 "A single mdoc authentication key shall not be used to produce both MACs and signatures during its lifetime." Both mechanisms are implemented and selected by `PresentationConfig.mdocDeviceAuth`, but a reused (`KeyUse.Rotate`) DeviceKey can MAC on one channel while signing on another — MAC needs an EReaderKey, which proximity always has and OpenID4VP has only for an encrypted response (unencrypted OID4VP / plain DC API always sign). `KeyUse.OneTime` batch keys satisfy the clause structurally; pinning the mechanism to the key is the general fix. **Deliberate — see [Deliberate non-goals](#deliberate-non-goals)** |
| NFC negotiated handover | §8.2.2.1/§9.1.5.1 | ⬜ static handover only (`[Hs, null]` hardcoded); no ReaderEngagement / Handover Request |
| Session termination | §9.1.1.4 | ✅ holder + reader send the status-20 termination frame after the exchange, destroy the session keys (`SessionEncryption.destroy`), and close; the received `status` is decoded (Table 20 10/11/20). BLE `End` command remains a demo-transport concern |
| BLE / NFC transports | §8.3.3.1 | 🟡 core SDK exposes a transport port only; GATT (both modes, MTU chunking) + NFC APDU live in the **Android demo**; **no iOS/Swift transport**; BLE Ident characteristic absent |
| MSO digest algorithms | §9.1.2.5 | 🟡 SHA-256 only (readers must also support SHA-384/512) |
| Ephemeral-key curves | §9.1.5.2 Table 22 | 🟡 P-256 only |
| `DeviceResponse` errors/status | §8.3.2.1.2.2-.3 | ⬜ `errors`/`documentErrors`/status-code semantics not parsed or emitted (holder always sends `status: 0`) |
| MSO optional fields | §9.1.2.4 | 🟡 `expectedUpdate`, `keyAuthorizations`, `keyInfo` not parsed |
| Wi-Fi Aware · server retrieval (WebAPI/OIDC) | §8.3.3.1.3/§8.3.3.2 (optional) | ⬜ |
| Shared mdoc golden vectors | — | ⬜ `vectors/` covers CBOR/COSE only; cross-language mdoc equivalence rests on round-trip tests + live interop |

### ISO/IEC TS 18013-7:2025 — coverage: Annex C complete, Annex B aligned to OID4VP 1.0 Final

| Gap | Spec ref | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| mdoc MAC auth in OID4VP | B.4.5 | ✅ `HeldMdoc` produces a `deviceMac` when the verifier requests it via `deviceauth_alg_values` (OpenID4VP §B.2.2): the `EMacKey` comes from ECDH between the mdoc `DeviceKey` and the verifier's response-encryption key (the `EReaderKey`, B.4.5), curve-matched, reusing `MdocDeviceAuth.emacKey`. Selection: forced when only MAC is accepted, else the `mdocDeviceAuth` preference (default `deviceSignature`). Needs an encrypted response (no enc key ⇒ signs) |
| Annex B curve set | B.5.2 Table B.8 | 🟡 P-256/384/521 only; no Brainpool / Curve25519/448 (P-256 satisfies the mdoc-side minimum) |
| Verifier-side HPKE decryption | C.4 Table C.3 | ✅ `Hpke.openBaseP256` + `RecipientKey` unseal the `org-iso-mdoc` response — the verifier holds the recipient private key (the `EncryptionInfo.recipientPublicKey` counterpart), decapsulates the KEM secret from `enc`, and AEAD-opens with the SessionTranscript as `info`. Combine with `MdocSessionTranscript.dcApiIsoMdoc` + `MdocReader` for a full reader path |
| Origin abort | C.5 | 🟡 origin is a required parameter folded into the transcript, but no explicit empty-origin abort |
| Server retrieval | §6.4 | n/a — the TS adds no requirements beyond 18013-5 |

## Deliberate non-goals

Not gaps to be closed later — decisions. Recorded so the matrix cannot be read as a to-do list.

| Item | Spec ref | Why not |
|---|---|---|
| TS-literal `OID4VPHandover` | 18013-7 B.4.4 | The TS predates OpenID4VP 1.0 Final, which replaced the `clientIdHash`/`responseUriHash` + `mdocGeneratedNonce` handover with `OpenID4VPHandover`/`OpenID4VPDCAPIHandover` (jwk-thumbprint form). We implement the Final form, which is what conformant verifiers send — `verifier.eudiw.dev` and `digital-credentials.dev` both interoperate live. Implementing the superseded form would break against them |
| `mdocGeneratedNonce` + the `apu` JWE header | 18013-7 B.4.3.3 / B.5.3 | `apu` is defined as the `mdocGeneratedNonce` *of the B.4.4 SessionTranscript*. With that handover gone there is no such nonce, so `apu` has nothing to carry. (`apv` and `kid` survive — see above) |
| **18013-7 Annex A** — website REST retrieval | Annex A | `RestApiOptions`, HTTP POST `application/cbor`, `OriginInfo`, `EngagementToApp`, `MacKeys`. Out of product scope: the SDK targets proximity (18013-5) and the browser-mediated DC API (Annex C), not a website REST channel |
| Accepting the legacy `vc+sd-jwt` typ | SD-JWT VC §2.2.1 | The only normative rule is "The `typ` value MUST use `dc+sd-jwt`". Accepting the pre-2024-11 name is suggested by a *non-normative* note (lower-case "should", and this draft's RFC 2119 boilerplate makes only upper-case keywords normative). We reject it: the rename was November 2024, nothing in this SDK's ecosystem emits or accepts it (the EUDI reference libraries, Multipaz, and `issuer.eudiw.dev` all use `dc+sd-jwt`), and `typ` exists to prevent type confusion (RFC 8725 §3.11) — every extra accepted value widens that surface for no interop gain. Pinned by `SdJwtVcTypTest` |
| Single-purpose mdoc auth key enforcement | 18013-5 §9.1.3.4 | Both mechanisms shipped; see the 18013-5 table. Accepted as a conformance gap, not a security one |

## Not yet / roadmap

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| SD-JWT VC Type Metadata (§4: vct resolution, `extends`, display, claim metadata, schema) + `vct#integrity` | ⬜ largest single gap; §4.7 is a step of the verification algorithm |
| OpenID4VP hardening: DCQL `multiple`, `require_cryptographic_holder_binding` | ⬜ the trust-free half of the OpenID4VP gap; `trusted_authorities` is sequenced with the trust cluster below |
| iOS proximity transport (CoreBluetooth / CoreNFC) + BLE Ident characteristic + session termination (status 20) | ⬜ Android demo adapters only |
| OpenID4VCI: `attestation` proof type, `credential_identifiers` | ⬜ |
| NFC negotiated handover (18013-5 §8.2.2.1) | ⬜ |
| Wallet Provider backend end-to-end (WUA issue → verify loop) | 🟡 backend exists (`wallet-provider/`); e2e loop closure pending |
| BLE / NFC transport production hardening | 🟡 demo adapters + live Multipaz interop done; reconnect / timeout / MTU / cancellation hardening pending |
| Shared mdoc golden vectors (MSO / DeviceResponse / SessionTranscript / deviceMac) | ⬜ cross-language equivalence currently via round-trip tests + live interop |

### Trust — deliberately sequenced last

Everything that needs standing trust infrastructure — a resolved trusted-list cache, federation paths,
revocation feeds — lands after the rest of the roadmap. The reason is dependency direction, not effort.
Each item is a *filter* over credentials the SDK can already issue, present, and verify, and none of them
is the security boundary: the Verifier validates issuer trust independently (OpenID4VP §6.1), and DCQL
matching is `SHOULD`. Building them early would mean carrying a cache-refresh, list-signature, and
revocation surface before the flows that consume it are frozen.

Within the cluster, `aki` goes first — it is the only member that needs no cache and can be tested
offline against a generated chain.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| DCQL `trusted_authorities` — `aki` | ⬜ self-contained byte compare; no cache, offline-testable |
| DCQL `trusted_authorities` — `etsi_tl` | ⬜ needs the TL cert-set cache (LOTL + cascading member-state lists) |
| DCQL `trusted_authorities` — `openid_federation` | ⬜ needs federation path resolution; shares a resolver with the client-ID prefix below |
| Client ID prefixes `verifier_attestation` / `decentralized_identifier` / `openid_federation` | ⬜ trust verifier handles x509_san_dns / x509_hash / redirect_uri only |
| LOTL Level 2 · CRL / OCSP real-time revocation | ⬜ |
